  The product is an application that allows users to track the inventory of their food in their kitchen. The product produced will be an application that allows the user to manually insert food items that are then stored in their online pantry. After those items are stored, the application will look for recipes in a database given the food filtered through tags, so the user can choose their preference on types of recipes. The application will also allow the user to save missing foods to their grocery list in case theyâ€™re offline.
